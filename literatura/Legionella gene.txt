Studies frequently focus on the abundant number of virulence factors present in this genus. However, what is often overlooked is the role of secondary metabolites from Legionella. Following whole genome sequencing, we assembled and annotated the Legionella parisiensis DSM 19216 genome. Together with 14 other members of the Legionella, we performed comparative genomics and analysed the secondary metabolite potential of each strain. We found that Legionella contains a huge variety of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are potentially making a significant number of novel natural products with undefined function. Surprisingly, only a single Sfp-like phosphopantetheinyl transferase is found in all Legionella strains analyzed that might be responsible for the activation of all carrier proteins in primary (fatty acid biosynthesis) and secondary metabolism (polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis). Using conserved active site motifs, we predict some novel compounds that are probably involved in cell-cell communication, differing to known communication systems. We identify several gene clusters, which may represent novel signaling mechanisms and demonstrate the natural product potential of Legionella.", "FAU": ["Tobias, Nicholas J", "Ahrendt, Tilman", "Schell, Ursula", "Miltenberger, Melissa", "Hilbi, Hubert", "Bode, Helge B"], "PHST": ["2016/06/29 [received]", "2016/10/25 [accepted]"], "MHDA": "2016/12/03 06:00", "JID": "101603425", "AID": ["10.7717/peerj.2720 [doi]", "2720 [pii]"]}

We describe here that trans-translation is essential in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the etiologic agent of Legionnaire's disease (LD), a severe form of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. The ssrA gene coding for tmRNA, the key component of trans-translation, could not be deleted in L. pneumophila. To circumvent this and analyse the consequences of impaired trans-translation, we placed ssrA under the control of a chemical inducer. Phenotypes associated with the inhibition of ssrA expression include growth arrest in rich medium, hampered cell division, and hindered ability to infect eukaryotic cells (amoebae and human macrophages). LD is often associated with failure of antibiotic treatment and death (>10% of clinical cases). Decreasing tmRNA levels led to significantly higher sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, including to erythromycin. We also detected a higher sensitivity to the transcription inhibitor rifampicin. Both antibiotics are recommended treatments for LD. Thus, interfering with trans-translation may not only halt the infection, but could also potentiate the recommended therapeutic treatments of LD.", "IS": "2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking)", "FAU": ["Brunel, Romain", "Charpentier, Xavier"], "PHST": ["2016/08/02 [received]", "2016/11/02 [accepted]"], "MHDA": "2016/11/29 06:00", "JID": "101563288", "AID": ["srep37935 [pii]", "10.1038/srep37935 [doi]"]}

The original function of natural transformation remains a subject of debate, but it is well established as a major player in genome evolution. Naturally transformable bacteria use a highly conserved DNA uptake system to internalize DNA and integrate it in their chromosome by homologous recombination. Expression of the DNA uptake system, often referred to as competence, is tightly controlled and induced by signals that are often elusive. Initially thought to be restricted to a few bacterial species, natural transformation increasingly seems widespread in bacteria. Yet, the triggering signals and regulatory mechanisms involved appear diverse and are understood only in a limited set of species. As a result, natural transformation in most bacterial species remains poorly documented and the potential impact of this mechanism on global genetic mobilization is likely underappreciated. Indeed, even when a conserved activator can be identified to artificially induce the expression of the DNA uptake system, the considered species may still remain non-transformable. Recent works indicate that the DNA uptake system is directly subjected to silencing. At least in Legionella pneumophila and possibly in other species, a small non-coding RNA prevents expression of the DNA uptake system. Silencing constitutes one more way bacteria control expression of their engine of genetic exchange. It may also be the underlying reason of the undetectable natural transformation of many bacterial species grown under laboratory conditions even though they possess a DNA uptake system.", "FAU": ["Attaiech, Laetitia", "Charpentier, Xavier"], "PHST": ["2016/10/18 [received]", "2016/11/02 [accepted]", "2016/10/31 [revised]"], "MHDA": "2016/11/09 06:00", "JID": "8004904", "AID": ["10.1007/s00294-016-0663-6 [doi]", "10.1007/s00294-016-0663-6 [pii]"]}

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses in our region, in children and adults with a pre-diagnosis of ARTI. METHODS: A total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed with the RespiFinder Smart 22 kit (PathoFinder BV, Netherlands) and the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 612 (72.4%) of the specimens. Overall, 902 pathogens were detected; 821 (91%) were viruses and 81 (9%) were bacteria. The most commonly detected pathogens were influenza A virus (IFV-A) (n = 219), influenza B virus (IFV-B) (n=157), rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 107), human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 91), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B (n = 64), adenovirus (n = 56), human coronaviruses (n = 51), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 49), parainfluenza viruses (n = 40), human metapneumovirus (n = 36), Bordetella pertussis (n = 15), Legionella pneumophila (n = 11), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (n = 6), respectively. Among the 215 (25.4%) co-infected cases, IFV-A/HBoV and IFV-A/IFV-B were the most common co-infections. IFV-A was the most prevalent agent in all age groups except for children under 5 years of age, in whom RSV A/B was the most common pathogen. Approximately two thirds of the respiratory viruses were detected in early spring and winter, with peaks in January, March, and April. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the prevalence and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses, our epidemiological data for the 2014 - 2015 season in Istanbul showed a predominance of IFV-A infections with a peak activity in early spring.

It is not known what other processes are controlled by GpsB. L. monocytogenes gpsB mutants are unable to grow at 42 degrees C, but we observed that spontaneous suppressors correcting this defect arise on agar plates with high frequency. We here describe a first set of gpsB suppressors that mapped to the clpC and murZ genes. While ClpC is the ATPase component of the Clp protease, MurZ is a paralogue of the listerial UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 1-carboxyvinyltransferase MurA. Both enzymes catalyze the enolpyruvyl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-GlcNAc, representing the first committed step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We confirmed that clean deletion of the clpC or murZ genes suppressed the DeltagpsB phenotype. It turned out that absence of either gene leads to accumulation of MurA and we show that artificial overexpression of MurA alone was sufficient for suppression. Inactivation of other UDP-GlcNAc consuming pathways also suppressed the heat-sensitive growth of the DeltagpsB mutant, suggesting that an increased influx of precursor molecules into peptidoglycan biosynthesis can compensate for the lack of GpsB. Our results support a model according to which PBP A1 becomes misregulated and thus toxic in the absence of GpsB due to unproductive consumption of cell wall precursor molecules. IMPORTANCE: The late cell division protein GpsB is important for cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. GpsB of the human pathogen L. monocytogenes interacts with one of the key enzymes of this pathway, penicillin binding protein A1 (PBP A1), and influences its activity. PBP A1 catalyzes the last two steps of cell wall biosynthesis, but it is unknown how GpsB controls PBP A1. We observed that a L. monocytogenes gpsB mutant forms spontaneous suppressors and have mapped their mutations to genes mediating and influencing the first step of cell wall biosynthesis, likely stimulating the influx of metabolites into this pathway. We assume that GpsB is important to ensure productive incorporation of cell wall precursors into the peptidoglycan sacculus by PBP A1.", "IS": "1098-5530 (Electronic) 0021-9193 (Linking)", "FAU": ["Rismondo, Jeanine", "Bender, Jennifer K", "Halbedel, Sven"], "MHDA": "2016/11/01 06:00", "JID": "2985120R", "AID": ["JB.00393-16 [pii]", "10.1128/JB.00393-16 [doi]"]}

This gene encodes a hypothetical protein predicted to be a membrane protein using in silico analysis. While no conserved domains were identified in Lpg1659, similar proteins are found in many Legionella species and other aquatic bacteria. RT-qPCR showed that lpg1659 is positively regulated by the alternative sigma factor RpoS, which is essential for Lp to survive in water. These observations suggest an important role of this novel protein in the survival of Lp in water. Deletion of lpg1659 did not affect cell morphology, membrane integrity or tolerance to high temperature. Moreover, lpg1659 was dispensable for growth of Lp in rich medium, and during infection of the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii and of THP-1 human macrophages. However, deletion of lpg1659 resulted in an early loss of culturability in water, while over-expression of this gene promoted the culturability of Lp. Therefore, these results suggest that lpg1659 is required for Lp to maintain culturability, and possibly long-term survival, in water. Since the loss of culturability observed in the absence of Lpg1659 was complemented by the addition of trace metals into water, this membrane protein is likely a transporter for acquiring essential trace metal for maintaining culturability in water and potentially in other metal-deprived conditions. Given its role in the survival of Lp in water, Lpg1659 was named LasM for Legionella aquatic survival membrane protein.", "FAU": ["Li, Laam", "Faucher, Sebastien P"], "PHST": ["2016/07/19 [received]", "2016/09/12 [accepted]"], "MHDA": "2016/10/14 06:00", "JID": "101585359", "AID": ["10.3389/fcimb.2016.00113 [doi]"]}
